# **2025 WRO Future Engineers** - Team **Pink Boba Pearls** ðŸŒ¸ðŸ§‹ðŸ«§
This repository is for the 2025 WRO Future Engineeers competition. We are a team of 2 high-school girls from Ontario, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ We are passionate about all things engineering - specifically computer science ðŸ’» and space ðŸš€

## The Hardware
1. **Microcontroller - [Microbit v2](https://microbit.org/buy/bbc-microbit-single/):** Together with the Siyeenove Mshield Pinout board - For controlling drive motor and steering servo motor based on input from the Raspberry Pi
2. **Single Board Computer (SBC) - [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 2GB](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/):** Vehicle mobility control
---

We also used
1. Sainsmart 160 degree wideangle 5PM camera for Raspberry Pi
2. Lego Technic - to build the chassis
3. 12V Lithium battery power supply
4. 12v to 5V Step-down converter - To supply power to Raspberry Pi and Microbit
5. L298N Motor Driver - To drive the 9V Lego DC motor
6. 9V Lego Motor
7. SG90 Micro Servo Motor
8. Various cables for power connections to the devices, USB cable for serial connection between Microbit and Raspberry Pi, and wires to transmit data from Microbit to the motors.  

Refer to the component schematic to connect all the above hardware together to make the car

## The Software

There are 2 important programs that make the car run

1. `obs_ch.py` - loaded to the Raspberry Pi to process the vision input from the camera. 
  * It is part of the crontab, which launches the program when the Raspberry Pi boots up 
  * Once it is ready, it sends a signal to the Microbit indicating that it is ready. If there is a problem with the Python Program loading, the signal to the Microbit will not be sent which will allow the user to fix the program. 
  * Then it listens to the Microbit's A button to be pressed to start the car which starts calculating and transmitting DC motor speed and Servo turn data to the Microbit. 
  * As the car runs, the program reads visual data from the camera frame by frame and processes it using proportional-derivative controller (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) to get the servo turn values, which is transmitted to the Microbit in real-time to control the cars turns
  * The program has 2 distinct vision processing logic inside it
    1. For the open run, it looks at the walls and uses PD control to keep the car between the walls
    2. For the obstacle run, it looks at the color blocks and uses PD control to turn the car to avoid the blocks. 
  Detailed explanation of the code is provided in the engineering documentation

2. `pi2mb_motors_control.py` - loaded to the Microbit to drive the pi2mb_motors_control
  * As soon as it starts, it initialized the motor speed to 0 and servo direction to 90 (which keeps the car straight)
  * It awaits signal from the Raspberry Pi to confirm it has started successfully. When it receives the confirmation, it displays an 'S' on the LED array
  * When the user presses the 'A' button, it transmits a 'go' signal to the Raspberry Pi and awaits acknowledgement from the Raspberry Pi. When the acknowledgement is received, it displays a '+' on the LED array indicating that the car has started.
  * It then receives the servo steering turn data and DC motor speed data as byte stream from the Raspberry Pi which is converted to numerical data, and split to integer values to be used for motor control
  * The servo turn angle is sent as analog signal to the servo motor directly. The 5V input required by the Servo is supplied by the Siyeenove Mshield board.
  * The speed data is sent as PWM signal to the L298N motor driver which uses the PWM signal and the power input from the 12V battery to drive the 9V DC motor. 
  * If the user wants to stop the car (and reset its values so the car can run again), they can simply press the 'A' button again which will signal the Raspberry Pi to stop the loop that processes vision data. 
  * If the user wants to kill the car (completely end the program), they can press the 'B' button which will signal the Raspbery Pi to exit the Python program

## Loading the software on to the hardware
Below section explains how to load each program on to their respective hardwares

**Getting `obs_ch.py` to run on the Raspberry Pi**

1. Follow the Raspberry Pi **[Getting Started page](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html)** and follow all the instructions to get the OS distribution loaded and Raspberry Pi booted up
`Tip` - Ensure you setup the **Raspberry Pi Connect" at the tail end of the instructions to connect to the Raspberry Pi with your laptop. Otherwise, a separate monitor, HDMI cable, keyboard and mouse will be required every time you connect the Raspberry Pi. 
2. When you access the Raspberry Pi, install a good Python editor like Geany or Thonny. It is possible to install Visual Studio Code, but we had performance issues since our Raspberry Pi only had 2GB RAM
3. We used Picamera2 libraries to access the camera. The instructions to follow are all over the place. Follow these instructions carefully to get the camera setup. 
  * Access Raspberry Pi and open the terminal window
  * [Update all the software](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/os.html#update-software) running on the Raspberry Pi. You may need to do this every few weeks 
  * Picamera2 may be preinstalled as part of the full software update. However, try the below command just to be sure. If it is not installed, this will install it. 
    ``sudo apt install -y python3-picamera2 --no-install-recommends``
